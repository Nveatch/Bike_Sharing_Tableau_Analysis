# bikesharing

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purposse of this analysis was to take bikesharing data from August of 2019 in New York City, and create visualizations using Tableau to assess the viability of a similar bikesharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Results
![Number of Rides](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_1.png)

* Bike sharing is popular in metro areas

![Trip Maps](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_2.png)

* From the top start/stop locations, most trips are short (within ~2 square miles) 

![Trip Length](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_3.png)

* Regardless of gender, most trips last only ~5-6 minutes

![Trip Times](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_4.png)

* Trips are most common during the week, and during rush hour times (7-9 AM, and 5-7 PM) 

![Demographics](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_5.png)

* ~75% of trips are by males
* ~80% of trips are by subscribers 

![Demographics with Trip Times](https://github.com/Nveatch/bikesharing/blob/main/resources/slide_6.png)

* Most trips are by male subscribers during weekday rush hour

## Summary

### Analysis of Charts
From these charts, I conclude a Des Moines bike sharing program would be successful for the following reasons:

1. From the 1st chart, bike sharing seems like a popular mode of transportation in metro areas

2. As most trips are short in both length and distance, bike sharing should be popular in any highly condensed areas (like major cities)

3. Because most trips are during weekday rush hour, areas such as cities with more jobs and rush hour traffic should be popular for bike sharing

4. Bike sharing is predominately done by males, and per the 2010 census, Des Moines has a higher percentage of males than New York City (48.90% vs. 46.20%), indicating as much or more popularity there

5. A high percentage of subscribers means consistent monthly revenue, making a bike sharing venture likely to succeed

### Additional Visualizations
Two additional visualizations I would perform would be:

1. User type by birth year, to assess if certain age brackets are more likely to be subscribers

2. Number of trips by birth year, to see if certain age brackets are more likely to use the bike sharing program

From these two charts, I would look for popular age brackets, and then compare age demographic census data between the two cities. For instance, if the 20-30 age group has the most subscribers and trips, and Des Moines has more people inside that age group than New York City, it would indicate a greater chance of a bike sharing program succeeding.
